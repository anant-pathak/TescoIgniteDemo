This contains a link to a video demo for an app I developed for Tesco. 
A native iOS app for Tesco TechDay 2017 attended by Technologists from around the world. Had functionalities like: Download directly from the App store, in app event registration, push notifications to app, upcoming event list, dynamic content, deep social media integration within the app e.g. tweets from within the app, un-read notifications along with a dynamic & professional looking design & UI, all the images and data could be controlled from a server in the backend in real-time.
